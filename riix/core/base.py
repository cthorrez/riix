    """
    Base class for online rating systems. This class provides a framework for implementing
    various online rating systems, such as Elo, Glicko, or TrueSkill. It defines the basic
    structure and common methods that all such systems might share.

    Attributes:
        rating_dim (int): Dimension of competitor ratings. This could be 1 for systems like Elo,
                          where each competitor has a single rating value, or more for systems
                          like TrueSkill that use multiple values (e.g., mean and standard deviation).
        competitors (list): A list of competitors within the rating system.
        num_competitors (int): The number of competitors in the system.

            competitors (list): A list of competitors to be included in the rating system. Each
                                competitor should have a structure or identifier compatible with
                                the specific rating system's requirements.
